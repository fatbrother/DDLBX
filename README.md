## Motivation

After learning so many programming languages, we found that there are so many duplicated syntaxes in each language. So we decided to create a new programming language that is easy to learn and use.

## Syntax

[BNF](docs/BNF.md)  
[Syntex](docs/syntex.md)
[Examples](docs/examples.md)

## References

Inspired by [DreamBerd](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd.git)  
Some syntaxes are from [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin.git)
